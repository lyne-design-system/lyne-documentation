# Lyne Design System

## Claim

Lyne is SBBâ€“CFFâ€“FFSs <span class="tag is-info expanded">ðŸ§ªexperimental</span>, interconnected, collaboration-focused open-source design system.

The system makes it easier for developers, designers and content authors to build, maintain, and scale products and digital experiences.

Lyne consists of working code, design tools, resources and documentation, but also provides guidance through patterns, practices and a shared vocabulary for common understanding. Everything connected with each other, in-sync and transparent â€” the Single Source of Truth.

Lyne empowers people and unites teams to work more efficiently and deliver more consistent experiences.

##### Notice:
The state of the Lyne documentation platform is *work in progress (WIP)* and is inspired by [Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com), [Duet](https://www.duetds.com), [Bolt](https://boltdesignsystem.com), [Spectrum](https://spectrum.adobe.com/). It uses their contents for the moment until Lyne will be mature enough/we have found enough contributors from different disciplines to have a more holistic view on the topic. But since we agree with their contents we list them on our documentation platform to get a feeling how the site once will look like.
