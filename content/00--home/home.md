# Lyne Design System

## Claim
Lyne is SBB–CFF–FFSs interconnected, collaboration-focused open-source design system.

The system makes it easier for developers, designers and content authors to build, maintain, and scale products and digital experiences.

Lyne consists of working code, design tools, resources and documentaiton, and provides guidance through patterns, practices and a shared vocabulary for common understanding. Everything connected with each other, in-sync and transparent — the Single Source of Truth.

Lyne empowers people and unites teams to work more efficiently and deliver more consistent experiences.
