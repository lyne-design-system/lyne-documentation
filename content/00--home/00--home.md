#### Notice
The state of the Lyne documentation platform is *work in progress (WIP)* and is inspired by [Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com), [Duet](https://www.duetds.com), [Bolt](https://boltdesignsystem.com), [Spectrum](https://spectrum.adobe.com/). The documentation platform uses some of their content until Lyne will be mature enough/we are enough contributors from different disciplines to provide a more holistic perspective on the topic and the necessary resources get provided to document them accordingly.
