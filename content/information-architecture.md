<sbb-title level="4">Status</sbb-title>

- [x] Approved as starting point by [Marius Bleuer](https://github.com/mbleuer), [Sabrina Heid](https://github.com/sabrinaheid), [Daniel Schindler](https://github.com/DanTheMen), [Yves Tscherry](https://github.com/feerglas), [Michael Zumstein](https://github.com/4aficiona2) on 15.09.2020

<sbb-title level="4">Notes</sbb-title>

Every menu item of the proposed IA which sits above the line aim's to guide users to get up and running (potential first time visitors/newcomers). Everything below the line aims to support returning users with day-to-day needs and activities.

We are aiming to reach and meet all defined user groups (design, development, writing, brand, mgmt, general) through the `Home` contents/links but also through the navigation tree.

Content sections of pages are highlighted by braces `()`

`Home` contains an introduction text with a link to _All about Lyne_ and multiple teasers to link to the _Get started_ guides for the most present Design System disciplines. _Start designing_ and _Start coding_ in the beginning, but at some point also _Start writing_(TBD), _Start contributing_, _What is happening_ and _Guidelines_.
