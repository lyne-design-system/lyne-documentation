# Information architecture (IA) for the Lyne (Web) documentation platform

#### Status
- [x] Approved as starting point by [Marius Bleuer](https://github.com/mbleuer), [Sabrina Heid](https://github.com/sabrinaheid), [Daniel Schindler](https://github.com/DanTheMen), [Yves Tscherry](https://github.com/feerglas), [Michael Zumstein](https://github.com/4aficiona2) on 15.09.2020

#### Notes
Every menu item of the proposed IA above the line aim's to guide users to get up and running (potential first time visitors/newcomers). Everything below the line aims to support returning users with day-to-day activities.

Content sections of pages are highlighted by braces `()`

**Home** contains an introduction text and multiple teasers to link to the *Get started* guides of the most frequent used Design System disciplines. Design and Development in the beginning, but also Start contributing, What is happening and Guidelines.

#### Proposed IA for left side navigation
