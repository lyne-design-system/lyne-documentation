_Lyne_ creates a shared workspace for designers, developers and their stakeholders.

The _Lyne Design System_ is a holistic approach towards a consistent, maintainable, <span class="is-highlighted">cross-company design language</span> for all SBB [web|digital] products/services for a <span class="is-highlighted">better common understanding</span> between stakeholders, content authors, designers and developers.

<sbb-title level="3" text="What Lyne consists of"></sbb-title>

The _Lyne Design System_ is based on an intuitive, unique — the Single Source of Truth — referential resource[this very website], including shared and well-documented guidelines, vocabulary and <span class="is-highlighted">processes</span>, design decisions (so called Design Tokens), as well as centralized, vendor and framework agnostic basic building blocks (Lyne Components).

<sbb-title level="3" text="What Lyne does"></sbb-title>

_Lyne_ documents, <span class="is-highlighted show-rocket-and-cash">standardizes and streamlines</span> the design and development process for SBB [web|digital] experiences transparently and <span class="is-highlighted">governs the design language of the SBB brand experience</span>.

The _Lyne Design System_ not only <span class="is-highlighted show-cash">enables an optimized collaboration</span> and integration workflow between the Design System Core Team and consumers (e.g. product teams) of _Lyne Design System_ but also <span class="is-highlighted show-rocket">accelerates the creation and development process(time to market)</span> in a sustainable, maintainable, and long term committed fashion.

<sbb-title level="3" text="Risks"></sbb-title>

General risks of a Design System which we always need to face and be aware of:

- Single Point of Failure (SPoF)
- Fear of harming the designers creativity
- Governance difficulties
  - Design System rejection/denial
  - Missing adoption
- Documentation — if not well enough documented
- Funding difficulties
