<h1 class="title is-1">All about Lyne Design System</h1>

Lyne Design System <span class="is-highlighted">– also just called *Lyne* –</span> is SBB–CFF–FFSs holistic, human-centered and collaboration-focused open-source design system.

We provide the building blocks to create consistent, scalable experiences across SBB [web|digital] products in a sustainable fashion with long term commitment.

Lyne consists of working code, design tools, resources and documentation, but also  provides guidance through patterns, practices and a shared vocabulary for common understanding. Everything connected with each other, <span class="is-highlighted">in-sync</span> and transparent — our common <span class="is-highlighted">Design Language</span> and the Single Source of Truth for SBB [web|digital] services and products.

Lyne empowers people and unites teams to work <span class="is-highlighted show-cash">more efficiently</span> and deliver <span class="is-highlighted show-cash">more consistent experiences</span>.

<div class="notification is-primary is-light">Lyne is the <strong>product name</strong> we chose for our design system. Therefore Lyne is not a derived nor bought of the self service or product. We are actively building and enhancing Lyne and so can you with your <a href="/contributing">contributions</a>.</div>

## Lyne behind the scenes

Check out the following sections and get to know Lyne more in depth.

At some we might use some jargon to be more specific to describe certain concepts or artifacts. If there are new or unknown terms, have a look at our [glossary](/about/glossary/) which might hold a description or explanation. Otherwise help us improve and check the <a href="/contributing">contributing</a> section.


### Goals and Benefits
Lyne creates a shared, connected and transparent workspace for designers, developers and their stakeholders. The Lyne Design System documents, standardizes and streamlines the design and development process for SBB [web|digital] experiences and governs the design language of the SBB brand experience.

We focus on people, their needs and use automation wherever possible to create optimized workflows and processes with resilient results — resilient design and code. Those help product teams to build SBB [web|digital] experiences more efficient and coherent. 

See our <span class="is-highlighted show-rocket-and-cash">[Goals and Benefits](/about/goals-and-benefits)</span> section to get more insights about the opportunities which Lyne brings with it.  

### What you get

Lyne provides certain artifacts, namely:
* Components
* Design Tokens
* Figma Team Library (with Styles & Components)
* Design Patterns

Check out the [What you get](/about/what-you-get/) section for further insights and with a more in depth explanation.

Besides the above listed artifacts Lyne is also everything in between, the glue which keeps all together and in our case even in-sync.

### Glossary
A Design System is a complex topic and introduces many new concepts, new tools and has its very distinct vocabulary, terminology and jargon.

Due to that we created a [glossary](/about/glossary/). It's the base of our shared language for a better common understanding and a clear communication.

The glossary acts as our dictionary since people from different disciplines are participating within the Lyne Design System.

If there are new or unknown terms, have a look at our [glossary](/about/glossary/) which might hold a description or explanation for you.
