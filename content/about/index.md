Lyne is SBB–CFF–FFSs holistic, human-centered and collaboration-focused open-source design system.

We provide the building blocks to create consistent experiences across SBB digital products in a sustainable fashion with long term commitment.

Lyne consists of working code, design tools, resources and documentation, but also  provides guidance through patterns, practices and a shared vocabulary for common understanding. Everything connected with each other, in-sync and transparent — our common Design Language and the Single Source of Truth.

Lyne empowers people and unites teams to work more efficiently and deliver more consistent experiences.
