We provide the building blocks to create consistent experiences across SBB [web|digital] products in a sustainable fashion with long term commitment.

Lyne consists of working code, design tools, resources and documentation, but also  provides guidance through patterns, practices and a shared vocabulary for common understanding. Everything connected with each other, in-sync and transparent — our common Design Language and the Single Source of Truth for SBB [web|digital] services and products.
