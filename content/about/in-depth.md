### What *Lyne* is and why we need it
The *[Lyne Design System](./02-vocabulary.mdx#lyne)* is a holistic approach towards a consistent, maintainable, cross-company design language for all SBB digital products/services for a better common understanding between stakeholders, content authors, designers and developers.

### What *Lyne* consists of
The *[Lyne Design System](./02-vocabulary.mdx#lyne)* is based on an intuitive, unique — the [Single Source of Truth](./02-vocabulary.mdx#ingle-source-of-truth) — referential resource, including shared and well-documented guidelines, [vocabulary](./02-vocabulary.mdx) and processes, design decisions (so called [Design Tokens](./02-vocabulary.mdx#design-token)), as well as centralized, vendor and framework agnostic basic building blocks ([Lyne Components](./02-vocabulary.mdx#lyne-components)).

### What *Lyne* does
The *[Lyne Design System](./02-vocabulary.mdx#lyne)* not only enables an optimized collaboration and integration workflow between the [Design System Core Team](./02-vocabulary.mdx#design-system-core-team) and consumers of *[Lyne Design System](./02-vocabulary.mdx#lyne)* but also accelerates the creation and development process (time to market) in a sustainable, maintainable, and long term committed fashion.
