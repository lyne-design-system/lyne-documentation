# All about Lyne

Lyne is SBB–CFF–FFSs <span class="tag is-info">🧪 experimental</span>, interconnected, collaboration-focused open-source design system.

The system makes it easier for developers, designers and content authors to build, maintain, and scale products and digital experiences.

Lyne consists of working code, design tools, resources and documentation, but also  provides guidance through patterns, practices and a shared vocabulary for common understanding. Everything connected with each other, in-sync and transparent — the Single Source of Truth.

Lyne empowers people and unites teams to work more efficiently and deliver more consistent experiences.

To fulfill our vision, we are building and maintaining [Lyne](#lyne), our [Design System](#design-system), which is and acts as our common language —  our [Single Source of Truth](#single-source-of-truth). For this purpose we use [Design Tokens](#design-token) as our design abstractions. Those Design Tokens are consumed by [Lyne Components](#lyne-components) via our [Design (Token) API](#design-token-api) and are integrated within our documentation.

Lyne Design Tokens and Lyne Components are available for developer and designer(coming).

### What *Lyne* is and why we need it
The Lyne Design System](./02-vocabulary.mdx#lyne)* is a holistic approach towards a consistent, maintainable, cross-company design language for all SBB digital products/services for a better common understanding between stakeholders, content authors, designers and developers.

### What *Lyne* consists of
The *[Lyne Design System](./02-vocabulary.mdx#lyne)* is based on an intuitive, unique — the [Single Source of Truth](./02-vocabulary.mdx#ingle-source-of-truth) — referential resource, including shared and well-documented guidelines, [vocabulary](./02-vocabulary.mdx) and processes, design decisions (so called [Design Tokens](./02-vocabulary.mdx#design-token)), as well as centralized, vendor and framework agnostic basic building blocks ([Lyne Components](./02-vocabulary.mdx#lyne-components)).

### What *Lyne* does
The *[Lyne Design System](./02-vocabulary.mdx#lyne)* not only enables an optimized collaboration and integration workflow between the [Design System Core Team](./02-vocabulary.mdx#design-system-core-team) and consumers of *[Lyne Design System](./02-vocabulary.mdx#lyne)* but also accelerates the creation and development process (time to market) in a sustainable, maintainable, and long term committed fashion.
