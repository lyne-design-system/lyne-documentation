To fulfill our vision, we are building and maintaining [Lyne](./02-vocabulary.mdx#lyne), our [Design System](./02-vocabulary.mdx#design-system). For this purpose we use [Design Tokens](./02-vocabulary.mdx#design-token) as our design abstractions. Those Design Tokens are defined and maintained within Figma, transformed to multiple formats, published and are then consumed by [Lyne Components](./02-vocabulary.mdx#lyne-components) via our [Design (Token) API](./02-vocabulary.mdx#design-token-api) and are integrated within our documentation platform.

- Figma Team Library
- Lyne Design Tokens are defined and modified within the Figma and published as Styles to the Team Lib. but also published to npm 
- Lyne Components
...

Lyne Design Tokens and Lyne Components are available for designer on Figma.
