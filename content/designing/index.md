Lyne provides certain artifacts for designer to get you up and running, namely:

* Design Patterns
* Design Tokens (as Figma Styles within the Figma Team Library)
* Components (as Figma Components within the Figma Team Library)

Lyne Design Tokens are defined and modified within Figma and published as Styles to the Figma Team Lib. and also published to npm to be consumed through code. See [How everything is related](/about/how-lyne-works#how-everything-is-related).
