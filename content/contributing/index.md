## Our contribution model

Lyne Design System is an **open source** project at SBB-CFF-FFS. We foster
open and inclusive design and development. If you are wondering about our
contribution process, you are in the right place. First off, thank you for 
your interest!

**But since we are in very early development phase, contributions are limited to 
the [Design System Core Team](/about/glossary#design-system-core-team). Once this project will be more mature, we invite
the community to participate and contribute to the Lyne Design System.**

We will accept contributions in the following areas:

* Bug or request
* Documentation
* [Component](/contributing/component/)
* Icon
* Pictogram
* Design Token
* Pattern
* Other contribution

Once you start contributing please follow [Lyne's Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/lyne-design-system/lyne/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
