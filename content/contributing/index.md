open and inclusive design and development. If you are wondering about our
contribution process, you are in the right place. First off, thank you for 
your interest!

**But since we are in very early development phase, contributions are limited to 
the [Design System Core Team](/about/glossary#design-system-core-team). Once this project will be more mature, we invite
the community to participate and contribute to the Lyne Design System.**

We will accept contributions in the following areas:

* Bug or request

* Icon
* Pictogram
* Design Token
* Pattern
* Other contribution
